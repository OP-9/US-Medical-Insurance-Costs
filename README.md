# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs
First GitHub project. Conducted an analysis with real world data on U.S. medical insurances costs and how certain factors (eg. being a smoker, age) contribute to insurance costs.

The following analyses were conducted: 
  1. Determine sample size (male v female)
  2. Average age to each gender
  3. Smoking's impact on insurance rates
  4. Determining if a regional impact exists
  5. Number of children and its impact on insurance rates
  6. BMI's impact on insurance rates
